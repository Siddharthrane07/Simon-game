Simon Game
Welcome to the Simon Game project! This project was created as part of my learning journey in web development.

Description
Simon Game is a classic memory game where players must remember and replicate a sequence of colors and sounds. It's a fun and challenging way to test your memory and reflexes. This project utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to bring the game to life in the browser.

Usage
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.
Enjoy the challenge and see how far you can go!
